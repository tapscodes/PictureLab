3. How many pixels are in a picture that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high?
- There are 307200 pixels in a 640 x 480 pixel picture.
### Activity 2
1. How can you make pink?
- 255,0,255
2. How can you make yellow?
- 255,255,0
3. How can you make purple?

### Activity 3
1. What is the row index for the top left corner of the picture?
- ?
2. What is the column index for the top left corner of the picture?
- ?
3. The width of this picture is 640. What is the right most column index?
- ?
4. The height of this picture is 480. What is the bottom most row index?
- ?
5. Does the row index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
- ?
6. Does the column index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
- ?
7. Set the zoom to 500%. Can you see squares of color? This is called pixelation. Pixelation means
displaying a picture so magnified that the individual pixels look like small squares.
- ?
### Activity 5
1. Open Picture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
- ?
2. Open SimplePicture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
- ?
3. Does the following code compile?
**DigitalPicture p = new DigitalPicture();**
- ?
4. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, would the following
code compile?
**DigitalPicture p = new SimplePicture();**
- ?
5. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture,
compile?
**DigitalPicture p = new Picture();**
- ?
6. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture,
compile?
**SimplePicture p = new Picture();**
- ?
7. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, does the following
code compile?
**Picture p = new SimplePicture();**
- ?

- **for (int row = 7; row < 17; row++)**
- **for (int col = 6; col < 15; col++)**
2. How many times would the body of this nested for loop execute?
